# ISBN-Converter

The following program is an ISBN check digit verifier and converter.
It can receive ISBN-10 and ISBN-13 input directly from the user or it
can read ISBN numbers from a file to verify and convert. ISBN numbers
can be loaded and saved via files and are stored in memory for use while
the program is running. Data is validated to ensure that ISBN numbers are
entered correctly. Files are validated to ensure data is loaded correctly
and that existing data is not overwritten without permission.
